# Checkout Staffing Planner

## Overview

The Checkout Staffing Planner is a REST server application designed to automate shift scheduling for supermarket checkout staff. It replaces a manual Excel-driven process with a structured, programmatic solution that enables efficient shift planning, employee preference management, and schedule retrieval.

## Features

* Wish Book Submission:
Employees can submit their preferred shifts (early or late) for specific dates.

* Admin Planning Tool:
Admins can assign employees to shifts based on submitted wishes, ensuring each employee works only one shift per day and each shift is staffed with exactly two employees.

* Schedule Access:
Both employees and admins can retrieve the finalized daily shift plan.
